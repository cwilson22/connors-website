My research is on network visualization and mathematical optimization, with a focus on quantifying aesthetics in network visualizations.\n\nI have a passion for open science and education. I love being able to make information available for anyone to useâ€”whether that's by being a tutor or teaching assistant, finding and wrangling years worth of uncatalogued benchmark datasets, or by unearthing new and faster visualization techniques with my research.",

Through an expansive computational evaluation, we explore how the techniques assist or inhibit one another. Our best-performing techniques yielded a median improvement of 2.5-17x depending on the solver used.",
